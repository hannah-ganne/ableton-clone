## Back-end

This project only has the static UI.

## Front-end

###  Front-end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have `npm` installed locally on your machine.

###  Front-end Installation ###

Clone this repository. From the root of the project, run `npm install`. 
You can then run the app with `npm start`
The app should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the app runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the app starts, e.g. `Something is already running on port 3000. Would you like to run the app on another port instead? (Y/n)` You can press `Y` to go ahead and open the app on another port.
